# Animation Shader Skill

## Description
A specialized skill for implementing and configuring animation-style shaders (Toon Shaders) in 3D rendering engines. It provides guidance on various techniques like outlines, rim lighting, and special effects using popular shader libraries.

## Workflow
1.  Analyze the user's visual goal (e.g., "I want a glowing outline").
2.  **Determine the Approach (Mandatory):**
    *   **Step 2a: Select Base Present:** You **MUST** first identify the overall style. If the user uses general terms like "anime", "toon", "animation shader", or "character shader", map this to a **Present** (e.g., **Basic Anime**) to establish the foundation. **Do not skip this step.**
    *   **Step 2b: Identify Specific Features:** Extract specific requirements (e.g., "Shadow Texture", "Rim Light") and map them to the **Feature List**.
    *   **Step 2c: Merge Requirements:** The final feature list is the combination of **ALL features from the selected Present** PLUS the **Specific Features** identified.
        *   *Example:* User asks for "Animation shader with Shadow Texture".
        *   *Action:* Select **Basic Anime** (Base) + **Shadow Texture** (Specific).
        *   *Result:* [3-Tone Shading, Outline, Base Color] (from Basic Anime) + [Shadow Texture].
3.  Consult the **Feature List** to find relevant techniques and documentation for the identified features. **You must address EVERY item in the final feature list from Step 2 (including both Base Present features and Specific Features).** If a feature is not found in the **Feature List**, check the **Details Features Document** for corresponding details. If it is still not found, implement it based on your own knowledge.
4.  Read the specific reference files identified. **You MUST read ALL reference files listed under each identified feature in the Feature List. Do not select just one file; read them all to gain a complete understanding.**
5.  Propose a solution or shader configuration based on the documentation.
6.  (Optional) If code/shader graph editing is needed, guide the user or generate the code.

### **Example Workflow Execution:**
*   **Scenario:** User wants "Animation shader with Shadow Texture".
*   **Determine the Approach (Step 2):**
    *   **Base Present:** **Basic Anime**
    *   **Specific Features:** **Shadow Texture**
    *   **Final Feature List:** [3-Tone Shading, Outline, Base Color] (from Basic Anime) + [Shadow Texture].
*   **Identified Features:**
    Read ALL files in the final feature list.
    1.  **Base Color** (from Basic Anime Preset) -> File:
        *   `references/lilToon/Details/01_Base_Main.md`
        *   `references/PoiyomiShaders/Details/01_Base_Main.md`
        *   `references/ToonShadingCollection/Details/03_Diffuse.md`
    2.  **3-Tone Shading** (from Basic Anime Preset) -> File:
        *   `references/lilToon/Details/02_Lighting_Shadows.md`
        *   `references/PoiyomiShaders/Details/02_Lighting_Shadows.md`
        *   `references/UnityChanToonShaderVer2/Details/01_DoubleShade.md`
        *   `references/ToonShadingCollection/Details/09_Lighting_Shadows.md`
    3.  **Outline** (from Basic Anime Preset) -> File:
        *   `references/lilToon/Details/08_Outline.md`
        *   `references/PoiyomiShaders/Details/05_Outline.md`
        *   `references/RToon/Details/03_Outline.md`
        *   `references/UnityChanToonShaderVer2/Details/03_Outline.md`
        *   `references/ToonShadingCollection/Details/02_Outline.md`
    4.  **Shadow Texture** (Specific Request) -> File: 
        *   `references/RToon/Details/02_ShadowT.md`
*   **Action:** You must call `read_file` for **ALL** of these files before writing any code. 
*   **Propose a solution or shader configuration based on the documentation.**
